# Palindrome
Creates the longest palindrome possible from a given input

Only lowercase alpha characters are valid inputs. There are no checks for numbers, symbols, or capitals, so don't bother trying them.

The purpose of this program is to read in a string of characters and then print the longest available palindrome using the available letters. The output is not a real word, just formatted using available letters.
